Build a simple HTML editor.

To heap.


- Editor based on built in browser editor.
- A small number of features.
- Text formatting. Bold (<em> and <strong>), italic, undeline. No colors and background formatting.
- Formatting via predefined stylesheets.
- Anchors, lists. Later tables.
- Ability to insert special characters.
- To format headings, paragraphs, code, blockquotes etc.
- To insert predefined snippets (Eg. a div containing an image and a small caption).
- All editable areas share the same toolbar.
- A "quick format" toolbar floating next to the selection. It contains bold, italic etc.



Before any major coding, need to see how manipulating the nodes from a selection affects the selection itself.

Offline Mutation History

Set IDs on all nodes of mutations (if not already set)
If a mutation change an ID then find that node in history. If the nodes are different, set a new ID for the modified node;
On window.beforeunload, send the history to a server
In constructor restore the history from the date sent above;
What about text nodes? They don't have IDs;

Lipsesc notele, dar:
- editorul lucreaza cu selectiii multiple (doar FF suporta)
- istoricul online/offline este facut
- zona editabila face highlight pe phrasing content-ul selectat (unde e cursorul)

Move current phrasing content highlighting in its own class
