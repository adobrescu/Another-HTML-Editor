Build a simple HTML editor.

To heap.


- Editor based on built in browser editor.
- A small number of features.
- Text formatting. Bold (<em> and <strong>), italic, undeline. No colors and background formatting.
- Formatting via predefined stylesheets.
- Anchors, lists. Later tables.
- Ability to insert special characters.
- To format headings, paragraphs, code, blockquotes etc.
- To insert predefined snippets (Eg. a div containing an image and a small caption).
- All editable areas share the same toolbar.
- A "quick format" toolbar floating next to the selection. It contains bold, italic etc.



Before any major coding, need to see how manipulating the nodes from a selection affects the selection itself.
