HTML editor
-----------

It must work with latest browser versions. FF, Chrome, Safari, Opera for Windows, Microsoft Edge. No IE.
Edge is not required, it may be dropped from compatibility list.

It won't allow to much visual formatting. No red text on green background, no Times New Roman after Arial.
Designers use Photoshop, Illustrator and CSS. So formatting will be supported only via css class names and semantic elements (STRONG, EM, A, DEL etc).

Do/undo via MuationObserver.
