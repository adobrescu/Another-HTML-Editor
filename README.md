HTML editor
-----------

It must work with latest browser versions. FF, Chrome, Safari, Opera for Windows, Microsoft Edge. No IE.
Edge is not required, it may be dropped from compatibility list.

It won't allow to much visual formatting. No red text on green background, no Times New Roman after Arial.
Designers use Photoshop, Illustrator and CSS. So formatting will be supported only via css class names and semantic elements (STRONG, EM, A, DEL etc).

Why
---

Need an editor that:

- has one floating toolbar for all editable areas;
- moves the toolbar to caret /user selection when the selection changes;
- doesn't modify the HTML source when switch between visual and code containers;
- table captions;
- [Explain its main blocks/templates editing feature]
